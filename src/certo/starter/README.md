# Certo workspace

Made by `certo init`. Run every command below from this folder.

## 1. Check your settings

```bash
certo check
```

Your model settings are in SETTINGS_FILE. `certo check` shows where each
setting comes from, then makes one small call to your model and confirms it
can call tools, which Certo's agent needs. If it reports a problem, fix the
settings as it says and run it again. To switch provider later, comment out
the two active lines in that file and uncomment the two for the provider
you want.

## 2. Run a task

```bash
certo tasks/wordle.md --project wordle
```

A task is a plain text file saying what to build. Open `tasks/wordle.md`
to see one, then write your own the same way. `tasks/asteroids.md` builds
a browser game and needs Node 18 or newer.

## 3. Find the result

Each project lands in its own folder under `projects/`, here
`projects/wordle/`. The last lines Certo prints are the verdict:

```
Verification: verified
```

`verified` means Certo re-ran the project's own tests itself, after the
agent said it was done, and they passed. Then play:

```bash
cd projects/wordle
python3 wordle.py
```

## Good to know

- **Cost.** A run with a cloud model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) uses your
  model credits. Certo prints the tokens used and the cost at the end of
  every run, under "Run summary".
- **Checking an existing repo.** `certo verify path/to/repo` runs Certo's
  verification (the project's own tests and build) with no agent and no
  model, so it costs nothing.
- **Ollama.** On a machine with less than 24 GB of GPU memory, Ollama's
  default context window is 4096 tokens. That's too short for an agent: the
  model loses the start of the task and wanders. Start the server with a
  larger one, for example `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=32768 ollama serve`, or
  move the context slider in the Ollama app's settings. `ollama ps` shows
  the context a loaded model got.
